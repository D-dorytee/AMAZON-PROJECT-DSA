## 🔎 Key Questions Explored

- What are the **top-selling products** by revenue and volume?
- Which **regions** contribute the most to overall sales?
- Which **time of the year** (monthly/quarterly) records the highest sales?
- What is the relationship between **discounts and profits**?
- How do **product categories** perform in terms of revenue and profitability?

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

Here are some sample insights generated during the analysis:

- 📦 **Laptops and Electronics** had the highest revenue but low profit margins.
- 🌍 **Western region** contributed over 40% of total sales.
- 🗓️ Sales peaked during **November and December**, likely due to holiday promotions.
- 📉 Excessive discounts beyond 20% started reducing overall profit significantly.
- 🔁 Repeat customers accounted for 32% of total purchases.

## 📐 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed null values
- Fixed incorrect data types (e.g., converting `Order Date` to datetime)
- Removed duplicate entries
- Handled outliers in `Sales` and `Profit`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distribution of sales and profits
- Created pivot tables for category-wise performance
- Identified trends over time using line plots

### 3. Visualization
- Bar charts for product sales
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Pie charts for regional distribution
- Line plots for sales over time
